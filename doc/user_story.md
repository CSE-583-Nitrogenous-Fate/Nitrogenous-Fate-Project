### User Characterization for NF Software ### 
The Nitrogenous Fate Software uses metabolite data of isotopically-labeled molecules (Nitrite, Ammonia, and Urea) through incubations from samples in the Equatorial Pacific to show pathways of nitrogen within communities through simple data visualization.

| User               | Needs and Desires  | Skill Level        | Use Cases          |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Research Scientist (Marine Biologist) | Track isotopically-labeled Nitrogen within marine communities. Desires a simple yet parameter-configurable interface with multiple options for visualization. | Highly skilled scientist who is familiar with basic data science tools | Run program as is
| Research Scientist (Generic) | Use software to track defined elements in a known system. Desires a simple yet highly parameter-configurable interface with multiple options for visualization.  | Highly skilled scientist who is familiar with basic data science tools and Github coding | Run program with customization
| Research Scientist (administrator) | Maintain, improve, and update program as needed. Desires a simple system reporting tool for user feedback. | Highly skilled scientist who is familiar with the coding used for the program | Run and add code or debug program |
| Researcher | Use software but without much knowledge of underlying mechanics. Desires a way to use the software without much research or professional background in the domain | Adequately skilled researcher who might not be familiar with data science tools | Run program with assistance |
