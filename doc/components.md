### Components ###
The Nitrogenous Fate Software uses metabolite data of isotopically-labeled molecules (Nitrite, Ammonia, and Urea) through incubations from samples in the equatorial Pacific to show pathways of nitrogen within communities through simple data visualization.
Based on the following use cases the following components are defined:
* Data Cleaning and Wrangling
* Data Processing 
* Data Visualization

These components are used together in separate scripts to be used for the two different datasets that can be analyzed in this software package - one for Dissolved (exo) and Particulate (endo) metabolite.

| Name  | Function               | Inputs            | Output                 | Interactions            |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Data Cleaning and Wrangling (Section I) | A `dataset` is loaded (either dissolved, exo or particulate, endo) and this component looks for relevant data (by column) from the data set. The script then calculates values for the following new columns which are appended to the `dataset` under a new file named `*_clean_areas.csv`: `filename`, `compound_name`, and `area`. It then computes an internal standard which is used to normalize data for use in section II, it creates two new columns for these values: `compoundname_IS` and `area_IS`, which are appended to the `dataset` under a new file names `*_IS_list.csv`.  | run nfex (nitrogenousfate.py) `Section I script` with data in `data_raw` folder. | component will output values for: `filename`, `compound_name`, `area`, `compoundname_IS` and `area_IS`. | User monitors for any errors. |
| BMISED Computation (Section II) | The new data in memory which now contains values in the new columns: `filename`, `compound_name`, `area`, `compoundname_IS` and `area_IS` is used to calculate BMISED values.  These values are placed in a new column: `bmised_area` and is saved in a dataset named `*_bmisedareas.csv`. | nfex `Section II script` runs using new data stored in memory. | component will output the `new dataset`: `*_bmisedareas.csv` for values in the new column: `bmised_area` in `results` folder.  | User monitors for any errors expects a CSV file in `results` folder. |
| Data Visualization (Section III) | The `new dataset` which now contains values in the new column `bmised_area` is used to generate data visualization. The Jupyter Notebook generates multiple data visualizations to choose from. The user may save them into files. | run Jupyter Notebook (XXXX.ipynb) `Section III script` with correct data in `results` folder. | component will output image files from user input in Jupyer Notebook script. | User monitors for any errors, uses Jupyter Notebook to generate and save visualization files. |


In total there will be two Python scripts one Jupyter Notebook in this package. A Section I and Section II are contained in one script each for Dissolved (exo) and Particulate (endo) metabolite data sets and one Jupyter Notebook for Section III Data Visualization.
