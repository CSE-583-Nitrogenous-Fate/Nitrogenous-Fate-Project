# NFEX Project Contributor List

The Nitrogenous Fate Software is a tool that normalizes data to minimize the effects of obscuring variation and quantifies metabolite production rates in the environment. It uses metabolite data of isotopically-labeled molecules (Nitrite, Ammonia, and Urea) through incubations from samples in the equatorial Pacific to show pathways of nitrogen within communities through simple data visualization.

We would like to thank all those who have spent their valuable time improving on the NFEX Project.
