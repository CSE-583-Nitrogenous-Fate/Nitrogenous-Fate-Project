CSE 583 Project

Quantify metabolite production rates in the environment. 
In 2023, the Ingalls lab carried out incubations with added 15NH4+, 15NO3- and 15N13C urea in deck incubations in the Equatorial Pacific. We  will measure the rate of intracellular and dissolved metabolite production in these samples by tracking the isotope label through community metabolism over time.
